TIC-TAC-TOE AI

This project is part of Task 2 of the CodSoft Internship, where we implement a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

Objective
 
-To develop a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where the user plays against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal moves every turn.

Technologies Used
 
-Python
-Math module (for scoring logic)
-Minimax Algorithm (for AI decision making)

Features

-Player vs AI interaction in console
-AI makes the best possible move using Minimax
-Detects win, loss, and draw conditions
-Option to play multiple rounds

How to Run

-Run the task2.py file in a Python environment or terminal.
-Enter your moves by selecting positions 1 to 9.
-Try to beat the AIâ€¦ if you can!

AI Logic (Minimax)

-Recursively evaluates all possible game states
-Maximizes AI's chances while minimizing the player's
-Returns the optimal move for every turn

Conclusion

-This project showcases how game logic and AI decision-making can be combined using Python. 
-The Minimax-based AI performs flawlessly, making it a great demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving in games.
